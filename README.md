## Dummy data
Future easy reference data, as persistence isn't currently configured in this microservice.

`"SN8, launched 09/12/2021. Launch, ascent, reorientation, and controlled descent were successful, but low pressure in the methane header tank kept the engines from producing enough thrust for the landing burn, destroying SN8 on impact."`

`"SN9, launched 02/02/2022. Ascent, engine cutoffs, reorientation and controlled descent were stable, but one engine's oxygen pre-burner failed, sending SN9 crashing into the landing pad."`

`"SN10, launched 03/03/2022. Landed without exploding. The test ended with a hard landing-at 10 m/s â€“ most likely due to partial helium ingestion from the fuel header tank. Three landing legs were not locked in place, producing a slight lean after landing. Although the vehicle initially remained intact, the impact crushed the legs and part of the leg skirt. Eight minutes later the prototype exploded"`
